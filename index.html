    <p>Testing stuffff</p><br>
    <p>Same thing should happen here, right?</p><br>
    I don't really remember how to do this :'D <br>
Those 2 years of coding practice went to waste <br>
<i>That's alright</i> <br>
<i>I forgot about the index.HTML thing </i> <br>
Wow, it's been way to long since I last coded a ny t h i n g <br>
What if I'm r e a l l y annoying by with the code?

Na, too much effort
The website itself shows that weird text all spaced out<br> 
but the actual code is just one letter in one line and another letter in another line <br>
This test just turned into me talking about stuff that don't make sense<br>
Whateverrrrrrr

O, WAIT
CAN I DO A COUNTDOWN????

<t:1725720480:F>
Doesn't work on notepad, might work on GitHub's direct testing website?<br>
No idea
Do I remember how to do an ellipse?
No idea
<ellipse=20,2,3;></body><br>
None of the ellipses or countdowns work the way I wrote it<br>

Lemme see if this code that I'm pasting in works
<div id="stopwatch">00:00:00</div>
<button onclick="startStopwatch()">Start</button>
<button onclick="stopStopwatch()">Stop</button>
<button onclick="resetStopwatch()">Reset</button>
It works, but it doesn't <i>work</i> work, which kinda sucks<br>
Let's just bring in a website for useless websites since even this website is too useless to do anything on it-<br>
The stopwatch won't even work-
