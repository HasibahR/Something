<h1>Hello Wold</h1> <br>
I don't really remember how to do this :'D <br>
Those 2 years of coding practice went to waste <br>
<i>That's alright</i> <br>
<i>I forgot about the index.HTML thing </i> <br>
Wow, it's been way to long since I last coded a ny t h i n g <br>
What if I'm r e a l l y annoying by with the code?

Na, too much effort
The website itself shows that weird text all spaced out<br> 
but the actual code is just one letter in one line and another letter in another line <br>
This test just turned into me talking about stuff that don't make sense<br>
Whateverrrrrrr

O, WAIT
CAN I DO A COUNTDOWN????
